Node.js - google
=====================

This module allows you to search google by scraping the results. It does NOT use the Google Search API. PLEASE DO NOT ABUSE THIS. The intent of using this is convenience vs the cruft that exists in the Google Search API.

This is not sponsored, supported, or affiliated with Google Inc.



Installation
------------

    npm install [-g] google



API Example
-------

This prints out the first 50 search results of the query `node.js best practices`.

```javascript
var google = require('google');

google.resultsPerPage = 25;
var nextCounter = 0;

google('node.js best practices', function(err, next, links){
  if (err) console.error(err);
  	
  for (var i = 0; i < links.length; ++i) {
    console.log(links[i].title + ' - ' + links[i].link); //link.href is an alias for link.link
    console.log(links[i].description + "\n");
  }

  if (nextCounter < 4) {
    nextCounter += 1;
    if (next) next();
  }

});
```



CLI
---

You can use the `google` package as a command line program as well. Just specify the `-g` flag when installing. The command line version outputs CSV data in the following format:

    "{{HREF}}","{{TITLE}}","{{DESCRIPTION}}"
